# QuackTrack

QuackTrack involves a system able to track a user’s manually inputted steps, as well as body dimensions, in order to output an analysis of the users health. In addition, where the system sees room for improvement of the user’s lifestyle, it notifies the user as such and encourage them with game-like attributes (levels, badges etc).

Following three sprints of development we managed to create a system that, through the use of a UI and database, can accept and store multiple streams of user input. It can also analyse this through the production of graphs to visually compare the user’s progress.

Future developments on our system may include features such as sharing data with other users in a community-like environment to foster a more competitive element to the PI system.
